# PassportPDF

The PassportPDF SDK, built upon the .NET 4.5 framework, provides an easy access to the different microservices available in the PassportPDF Web API.
It contains all the data structures required to describe the parameters, as well as the responses, respectively received and sent by the Web API.
Each microservice available in the latter can be consumed using the associated method in the SDK, thus reducing the completion of complex document-managing-related operations to a mere method call.
